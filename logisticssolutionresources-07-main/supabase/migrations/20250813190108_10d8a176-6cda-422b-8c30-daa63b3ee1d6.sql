-- Final fix for security definer view warning
-- The linter is still detecting SECURITY DEFINER usage

-- Check if there are any remaining views with SECURITY DEFINER and remove them
-- We'll use a completely different approach that doesn't trigger security warnings

-- Drop the dashboard_stats view completely 
DROP VIEW IF EXISTS public.dashboard_stats;

-- Drop the function that uses SECURITY DEFINER
DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS public.get_system_dashboard_stats();

-- Create a simple, secure view that only shows counts for the current user's organization
-- This relies entirely on the RLS policies of the underlying tables for security
CREATE VIEW public.dashboard_stats AS
WITH user_org AS (
    SELECT organization_id 
    FROM public.profiles 
    WHERE id = auth.uid()
    LIMIT 1
)
SELECT 
    -- All these queries will be filtered by the underlying table's RLS policies
    -- so users will only see data from their own organization
