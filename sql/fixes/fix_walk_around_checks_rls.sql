-- Fix RLS policies for walk_around_checks table
-- The 400 errors might be due to overly restrictive RLS policies

-- Drop existing policies if they exist
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view walk around checks from their organization" ON public.walk_around_checks;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can insert walk around checks for their organization" ON public.walk_around_checks;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can update walk around checks from their organization" ON public.walk_around_checks;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can delete walk around checks from their organization" ON public.walk_around_checks;

-- Create more permissive policies for testing
-- Allow authenticated users to view all walk-around checks (for now)
CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated users to view walk around checks" ON public.walk_around_checks

-- Allow authenticated users to insert walk-around checks
CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated users to insert walk around checks" ON public.walk_around_checks

-- Allow authenticated users to update walk-around checks
CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated users to update walk around checks" ON public.walk_around_checks

-- Allow authenticated users to delete walk-around checks
CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated users to delete walk around checks" ON public.walk_around_checks
